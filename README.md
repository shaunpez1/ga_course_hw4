# Shakespeare's Plays

In this project we will be practicing selecting DOM elements and manipulating them using JavaScript.

- Here are the steps you will need to follow:
	- Download the starter code.
	- Add a class of `special` to all of the `<li>` elements at the second level of the nested list.
	- Add a class of `year` to all of the table cells in the third column of a table.
		- Hint: Take a look at how many columns are in each table.
	- Make every other table row in both tables have a gray background.
	- Select an anchor tag that has a link to a pdf file. Change the color to blue and increase the font size.
	- Select an anchor tag that has an href attribute containing the substring "asyoulikeit" and change the font color to orange.
